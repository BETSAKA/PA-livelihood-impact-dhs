POUR DHS III (1997)

HW1 Age in months of the child is calculated from the country month code of the date of
interview less the century month code of the date of birth of the child.

HW2 Weight in kilograms. There is one implied decimal place in the weight (decimal points
are not included in the data file).  To produce the weight in kilograms divide by 10.

HW3 Height in centimeters. There is one implied decimal place in the height (decimal points
are not included in the data file).  To produce the height in centimeters divide by 10.
Height is supposed to be the recumbent length for children less than 24 months old and
the standing height for children born 24 or more months prior to the interview.

HW4 Height for Age percentile.
HW5 Height for Age standard deviations from the reference median.
HW6 Height for Age percent of reference median.
HW7 Weight for Age percentile.
HW8 Weight for Age standard deviations from the reference median.
HW9 Weight for Age percent of reference median.
HW10 Weight for Height percentile.
HW11 Weight for Height standard deviations from the reference median.
HW12 Weight for Height percent of reference median.

The measures above were calculated using the CDC Standard Deviation-derived Growth
Reference Curves derived from the NCHS/FELS/CDC Reference Population. The
measures are presented with two implied decimal places (no decimal points are included
in the data file).  To produce the actual measure, divide the variable by 100.  If either
the weight or the height of the child is missing then all of the above measures are set to
the missing code 9999 or 99999.  If either the height or the weight is outside of the
acceptable range for the calculation of these measures then all of the above measures
is set to code 9998 or 99998.

DHS V (1997)

HW1 Age in months of the child is calculated from the country month code of the date of 
interview less the century month code of the date of birth of the child. 

 

HW2 Weight in kilograms. There is one implied decimal place in the weight (decimal points 
are not included in the data file).  To produce the weight in kilograms divide HW2 by 
10. 

 

HW3 Height in centimeters. There is one implied decimal place in the height (decimal points 
are not included in the data file).  To produce the height in centimeters divide HW3 by 
10.  Height is supposed to be the recumbent length for children less than 24 months old 
and the standing height for children born 24 or more months prior to the interview. 

 

HW4 Height for Age percentile. 
HW5 Height for Age standard deviations from the reference median. 
HW6 Height for Age percent of reference median. 
HW7 Weight for Age percentile. 
HW8 Weight for Age standard deviations from the reference median. 
HW9 Weight for Age percent of reference median. 
HW10 Weight for Height percentile. 
HW11 Weight for Height standard deviations from the reference median. 
HW12 Weight for Height percent of reference median. 

 

The measures above were calculated using the CDC Standard Deviation-derived Growth 
Reference Curves derived from the NCHS/FELS/CDC Reference Population. The 
measures are presented with two implied decimal places (no decimal points are included

weight or the height of the child is missing then all of the above measures are set to the

acceptable range for the calculation of these measures then all of the above measures is 
set to code 9998 or 99998.

HW70 Height for age standard deviation (according to WHO) 
HW71 Weight for age standard deviation (according to WHO) 
HW72 Weight for height standard deviations (according to WHO) 
HW73 BMI standard deviations (according to WHO) 

 

The measures above were calculated using the new Child Growth Standards released by 
the World Health Organization on April 27 2006.  The new Standards are the result of an 
intensive study initiated by WHO in 1997 to develop a new international standard for 
assessing the physical growth nutritional status and motor development in all children 
from birth to age five. WHO and its principal partner, the United Nations University, 
undertook a Multi-centre Growth Reference Study which is a community-based, multi-
country projects involving more than eight thousand children from Brazil, Ghana, India, 
Norway, Oman, and the United States of America.   The measures are presented with 
two implied decimal places (no decimal points are included in the data file).  To produce 
the actual measure, divide the variable by 100.  If either the weight or the height of the 
child is missing then all of the above measures are set to the missing code 9999 or 
99999.  If either the height or the weight is outside of the acceptable range for the 
calculation of these measures then all of the above measures is set to code 9998 or 
99998.

DHS 7 (2021)

HW1 Age in months of the child is calculated from the country month code of the date of 
interview less the century month code of the date of birth of the child. 
BASE: All children born 0-59 months prior to the survey and alive with information 
from the household questionnaire (B19(HWIDX) < 60 and (B5(HWIDX = 1). 
Height and Weight 
HW2 Weight in kilograms. There is one implied decimal place in the weight (decimal points 
are not included in the data file).  To produce the weight in kilograms divide HW2 by 
10. 
HW3 Height in centimeters. There is one implied decimal place in the height (decimal points 
are not included in the data file).  To produce the height in centimeters divide HW3 by 
10. Height is supposed to be the recumbent length for children less than 24 months old
and the standing height for children born 24 or more months prior to the interview.
HW4 Height for Age percentile 
HW5 Height for Age standard deviations from the reference median 
HW6 Height for Age percent of reference median 
HW7 Weight for Age percentile 
HW8 Weight for Age standard deviations from the reference median 
HW9 Weight for Age percent of reference median 
HW10 Weight for Height percentile 
HW11 Weight for Height standard deviations from the reference median 
HW12 Weight for Height percent of reference median
